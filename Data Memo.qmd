## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}
library(readr)
amazon <- read_csv("~/Desktop/Pstat 134/Final/amazon.csv")

which(is.na(amazon))
sum(is.na(amazon))
```

## **An overview of your dataset**

What does it include?

-   This dataset includes information for over 1,000 Amazon products, including their ratings, reviews, pricing, discounts, and descriptive details.

Where and how will you be obtaining it? Include the link and source. If you plan on creating a web scraper or using an API, describe your plans.

-   <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset> 

About how many observations? How many predictors?

-   The dataset includes **1,000+ observations**, representing Amazon products. The dataset includes **16 features**, such as:

    -   product_id, product_name, category, discounted_price, rating, rating_count, review_title, etc

What types of variables will you be working with?

-   We will work with category, discounted_price, rating, actual_price

-   Once we start and we find that another variable is useful, we will use it as well. 

Is there any missing data? About how much? Do you have an idea for how to handle it?

-   This data set does not contain too much missing data. Only 3 missing data, from that we will manually fill out the missing data.

## **An overview of your research question(s)**

What variable(s) are you interested in predicting? What question(s) are you interested in answering?

-   The variable we are interested in predicting is product_name.

-   Questions

    -   What products are similar to what a user has already bought?

    -   What products might a user purchase next?

Name your response/outcome variable(s) and briefly describe it/them.

-   For a recommendation system: Focus on rating or review_content.

-   For pricing analysis: Use discounted_price or discount_percentage.

Which predictors do you think will be especially useful?

-   User ID: Key for identifying individual preferences and enabling personalized recommendations.

-   Ratings/Reviews: Indicates user sentiment towards products. Collaborative filtering often uses this information to predict preferences.

Is the goal of your model descriptive, predictive, inferential, or a combination? Explain.

-   The goal of the model is predictive as it is a recommendation system. It is predictive as it is used to recommend products users are likely to interact with.

## **Your proposed project timeline**

When do you plan on having your data set loaded, beginning your exploratory data analysis, etc?

-   We plan to have the data set loaded in week 4 and start exploratory data analysis week 4-5.

Provide a general timeline for the rest of the quarter.

-   Week 4: Load data set. Build the skeleton and ensure basis of our project, who works on what and how we share code

-   Week 5-6: continue with the code compare prices and ratings

-   Week 7-8: Report findings and Make it pretty and presentable

-   Week 9: OH make sure runs smoothly 

## **Any questions or concerns**

Are there any problems or difficult aspects of the project you anticipate?

-   I think some problems we will run into would be using gibhut, since no one in our team has used it before. It will definitely will be a learning curve.

-   Another difficult aspect would be using python. Since most of us has only worked in projects with R so doing a big project in python will be difficult.

Any specific questions you have for me/the instructional team?

-   will we be shown how to use github as a team to push and pull our code?
